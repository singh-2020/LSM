## File: `week_one.py`

The file includes solutions to the following problems:

# 1. If-Else Task
Uses conditional logic to determine if a number is "Acceptable" or "Not acceptable" based on divisibility by 3 and its range.

# 2. Arithmetic Operators
Performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two input integers.

# 3. Compress the String
Compresses a string using itertools.groupby() to count consecutive characters and returns their frequency and value.

# 4. The Minion Game
A game where two players (Stuart and Kevin) earn points based on substrings formed from vowels and consonants.

# 5. Leap Year Checker
Determines whether a given year is a leap year based on the standard Gregorian calendar rules.

### 6. Word Order Counter
Counts the number of occurrences of words in input while maintaining their original input order.

# 7. Iterables and Iterators
Calculates the probability that a randomly chosen combination of letters contains the letter 'a'.

# 8. Tuples (Hash)
Reads a list of integers, stores them in a tuple, and prints the hash value of the tuple.

# 9. Finding the Percentage
Reads a dictionary of students and their marks, and calculates the average of a specific student's marks to two decimal places.

# 10. String Formatting
Formats and prints numbers from 1 to n in decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary, aligned properly.
